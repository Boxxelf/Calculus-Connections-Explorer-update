For example, simulating a bouncing ball requires solving an ODE to account for gravity and collisions. By setting initial conditions and boundary constraints, animators can control the motion while maintaining physical accuracy. This connection between calculus and computer science enables the creation of lifelike animations in films, games, and simulations.","Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.443); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.421); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.441); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.443); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.427); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.421)"
Calculus II,Parametric equations,"Mathematics of vectors, curves, and surfaces",2,"Parametric equations are essential in computer science for representing vectors, curves, and surfaces in geometric modeling and computer graphics. A parametric curve is defined by vector-valued functions \( p(t) = [g(t), h(t)] \), where \( t \) is a parameter that continuously varies, generating points along the curve. This approach allows precise control over the shape and behavior of curves, enabling smooth transitions and complex geometries. For instance, in animation, parametric equations can describe the trajectory of a moving object, where \( g(t) \) and \( h(t) \) represent its position over time. Additionally, derivatives of parametric functions provide tangent and normal vectors, critical for calculating lighting and surface interactions in 3D rendering.","Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.54); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.58); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.54); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.418); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.376); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.417)"
Calculus II,Parametric equations,Curves and surfaces,2,"Parametric equations are essential in computer science for modeling curves and surfaces, as they allow precise control over geometric shapes using a parameter \( t \). A parametric curve is defined by functions \( x = g(t) \) and \( y = h(t) \), where \( t \) continuously varies to trace the curve. This is particularly useful in computer graphics to represent complex shapes, such as a curve composed of line segments and arcs. Arc-length parameterization, where \( t \) corresponds to the distance along the curve, ensures uniform traversal speed, which is critical for animations or simulations. For example, rendering a smooth transition along a circular arc requires calculating positions using \( t \) mapped to arc length.","Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.378); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.55); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.54); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.378); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.376); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.379)"
