For example, machine learning algorithms often aim to approximate a target function \( f(x) \) by minimizing error over a sequence of training data. As the size of the dataset grows, the algorithm's predictions typically converge to the true function, assuming the model and hypothesis space are appropriately chosen. This connection highlights the importance of sequences in analyzing the scalability and reliability of learning systems.",AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.799); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.9); Introduction_to_algorithms-3rd Edition.pdf (p.1164); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.333); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.1068); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.787)
Calculus II,Series,Regression analysis,1,"In regression analysis, particularly in autoregressive models for time series, calculus concepts like series play a crucial role. A series represents the summation of terms, often used to model cumulative effects over time. In autoregressive models, the current value of a variable \( y_t \) is expressed as a weighted sum of its previous values, \( y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \dots \), plus a noise term. This summation inherently relies on series concepts to capture dependencies across time intervals. For example, predicting stock prices might involve summing weighted past prices to forecast future trends. Understanding series enables computer scientists to design and optimize such models effectively, ensuring accurate predictions in dynamic systems.",Introduction_to_algorithms-3rd Edition.pdf (p.1178); Introduction_to_algorithms-3rd Edition.pdf (p.1164); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.737); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.760); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.737); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.586)
Calculus II,Convergence and divergence,Gradient descent,2,"Gradient descent, a key optimization algorithm in machine learning, relies on the principles of convergence and divergence to minimize a loss function \( L(w) \). Convergence occurs when the algorithm iteratively updates parameters \( w \) using \( w_i \leftarrow w_i - \alpha \frac{\partial L(w)}{\partial w_i} \), where \( \alpha \) is the step size or learning rate. If \( \alpha \) is too large, the updates may overshoot the minimum, causing divergence; if too small, convergence may be excessively slow. For example, in stochastic gradient descent, convergence to a global minimum is guaranteed with a sufficiently small \( \alpha \), but the process may require many iterations. Understanding convergence ensures efficient and accurate model training in computer science applications.","AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.739); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.738); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.46); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.743); Introduction_to_algorithms-3rd Edition.pdf (p.15); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.799)"
Calculus II,Taylor series,Gradient descent,2,"The Taylor series is fundamental in approximating complex functions using polynomials, which directly supports optimization techniques like gradient descent in computer science. Gradient descent iteratively minimizes a loss function by updating parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. When higher-order derivatives are included, as in second-order optimization methods like Newton-Raphson, the Taylor series provides a local polynomial approximation of the function, enabling more precise updates. For example, Newton-Raphson uses the second derivative (Hessian matrix) to refine parameter updates, improving convergence speed compared to first-order methods. This connection highlights how calculus tools like Taylor series enhance computational efficiency in machine learning and optimization tasks.","AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.151); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.46); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.738); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.737); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.738); AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.745)"
Calculus II,Polar coordinates,Data analysis,1,"Polar coordinates provide an alternative representation of data, using radius \( r \) and angle \( \theta \) instead of Cartesian \( (x, y) \). This transformation is valuable in data analysis, particularly when working with circular or periodic patterns, as polar coordinates can simplify feature extraction and visualization. For example, in machine learning, nonlinear transformations like the kernel trick in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) embed data into higher-dimensional spaces for linear separability. Similarly, polar transformations can reveal structure or clusters in datasets that are obscured in Cartesian form, aiding dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection in visualization pipelines. This flexibility enhances computational efficiency and interpretability in complex datasets.","AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf (p.763); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.684); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.707); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.144); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.23); Marschner, Shirley - Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th ed).pdf (p.706)"
